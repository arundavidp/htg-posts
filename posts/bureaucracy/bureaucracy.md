Knowing where to turn for assistance from your home country's government while living in Germany is crucial.

Embassies and consulates throughout Germany provide a broad spectrum of services, from passport and visa issuance to legal aid and emergency services.

To ensure that you receive the appropriate assistance, it's essential to conduct research on the embassy or consulate nearest to you, including their specific services and operating hours.

Germany's civil law system relies on written statutes and codes rather than common law precedents. The legal system is split into different courts and jurisdictions, each specialising in particular areas.

If you encounter a legal matter in Germany, it's crucial to consult with a professional for legal advice.

If you are a U.S. citizen in Germany, you can still vote in U.S. federal elections. You can register to vote through the Federal Voting Assistance Program, which assists U.S. citizens living abroad. You can also vote in person at a U.S. embassy or consulate in Germany or by absentee ballot.

Registering to vote and requesting an absentee ballot well before the election is important to ensure that your vote is counted.
