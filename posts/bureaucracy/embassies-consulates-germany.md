These diplomatic outposts are here to help. Here’s a quick rundown on what they can — and can’t — do for you.

Embassies and consulates in Germany are set up not only to further contacts with the Germans, but also to provide a number of useful services for their citizens if they happen to be traveling or living here. It is their duty, for example, to help their citizens abroad in times of emergency.

## What they can do for you
Don’t expect them to intervene in court proceedings; get you out of prison; give legal advice or instigate court proceedings on your behalf; get better treatment for you in a hospital or prison than is provided for German nationals; investigate a crime; pay your hotel, legal, medical or any other bills; pay for travel tickets for you; undertake work more properly done by travel representatives, airlines, banks or motoring organizations, or obtain accommodation, work or a residence permit for you. They can, however, tell you who can do these things for you.

Expatriates living in Germany are subject to the jurisdiction of German law and regulations. If they become involved in private disputes with foreign nationals or business enterprises, and the controversy can’t be settled amicably, the normal recourse is to the remedies provided by German law.

Diplomatic or consular officers may not act as attorneys or agents in private matters. Again, however, they will provide you a list of names and telephone numbers of those who can help.


## Embassies & Consulates in Germany

### United States

The new American embassy in Berlin opened with much ceremony on Independence Day 2008, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former President George H.W. Bush as speakers. The structure rises four and a quarter stories and closes the last frontage on the historic Pariser Platz, which was a wasteland during the cold war because of its proximity to the Berlin Wall. It’s now a bustling, traffic-free square dominated by the Brandenburg Gate. A green band of trees, gardens and walkways is created along the embassy’s street fronts. In the courtyard is an American eagle made by Germany’s famous Meissen porcelain manufacturer. Close by are the embassies of World War II allies, Britain and France; the Reichstag, Germany’s parliament; the Holocaust Museum, and the elegant Hotel Adlon The ambassador’s office is in a penthouse, which overlooks the embassy’s rooftop garden. It was so constructed that the horses atop the Brandenburg Gate seem to ride across a field of native American grass.

Also as a security precaution the American Consulate in Frankfurt has moved from its Westend location to the site of a former U.S. Army hospital in an outlying district. The area is large and easily fenced in. It houses many U.S. government agencies and has administrative and logistic functions for many of the other missions in the eastern hemisphere.

In contrast to citizens of most other countries, Americans living abroad must file American tax returns and even pay American taxes in a number of cases. To lead them through the complexities of such matters the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) maintains an office at the Berlin embassy, and IRS people usually tour the embassy and consulates in February and March. [See the separate article on U.S. taxes.](https://howtogermany.com/pages/ustaxes.html)

In addition to the normal services provided (listed in the article) the US State Department provides the following:

In An Emergency — Your family may need to reach you because of an emergency at home or because they are worried about your welfare. They should call the State Department’s Overseas Citizens Services at (202) 647-5225. The State Department will relay the message to your local Consulate. Consular officers will attempt to locate you and pass on urgent messages.

Distribution of Federal Benefits Payments — Over a half-million people living overseas receive monthly federal benefit payments. In many countries, the checks are mailed to the U.S. embassy or consulate and distributed through the local postal service.

Assistance In Child Custody Disputes — In an international custody dispute, a consul can try to locate the child abroad, monitor the child’s welfare, and provide general information to the American parent about laws and procedures which may be used to effect the child’s return to the United States. Consuls may not take custody of a child, or help a parent regain custody of a child illegally or by force or deception.

E-Mail Subscriber Service: The U.S. Embassy now offers a free e-mail subscriber service that allows Americans in Germany to receive instant messages concerning security and travel warnings, as well as regular updates on voting, taxes, and other issues of importance.

To subscribe to the Germany ACS service, simply send a blank e-mail to GermanyACS-subscribe@Listbot.com. You will receive a confirmation message requiring you to send a blank reply to listbot.com. Upon sending the reply, your subscription will be confirmed and you will automatically receive public announcements and other messages in the future

### United Kingdom

The British embassy is now occupying its prewar site at Wilhelmstrasse 70-71. This plot of land was acquired by the British government in 1884 and used as an embassy right up to the outbreak of World War II. The original building was all but completely destroyed in the war.

The new building, opened by Queen Elizabeth in 2000, is very modern inside with bright colors, shining metal, an open-plan interior and wood-paneled floors. It’s a far cry from the traditional Victorian view of Britain, though the exterior harmonizes with the nearby Brandenburg Gate and Hotel Adlon. The front gate of the old embassy, bearing the British coat of arms, survived the air raids and has been made a feature of the present building.

### Canada

Canada, too, has moved into a new embassy, in the former “no man’s land” between east and west. The embassy is using native materials (yellow limestone from Manitoba, beechwood from Ontario, oak from Quebec) to create a very representative structure, with such features as a “Timber Hall”, “Garden Court” and “Welcoming Water Garden.” You can take a virtual tour of the new building at the embassy’s website.
